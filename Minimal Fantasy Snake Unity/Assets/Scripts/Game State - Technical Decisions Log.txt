[Game State System] | Technical Decisions Log

Problem: What Pattern I should do with this system?
Options: 
	- State Pattern
	- Strategy Pattern
	- Observer Pattern
Decision:  State Pattern
Reason:	More suitable because
		- Makes it easy to add/remove/modify state without touching the handler code
		- Strategy Pattern is better for Logic
		- Observer Pattern is better for UI

IGameState
- IEnumerator Execute()

GameStateManager
- Coroutine currentState
- SetUpState        // For Set Up Game
- InputState        // For Wait Player Input
- WalkState         // For Wait Hero Walk Anim
- CombatState       // For Auto Combat
- PostCombatState   // For Check More Condition
- GameOverState     // For Game Over Step
